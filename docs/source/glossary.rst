Tahoe-LAFS Terms & Definitions
==============================


.. glossary::

    Alias
        the mapping from human-readable name to Tahoe URI (capability string)

    bucket
        a group of one or more immutable shares held by a storage server and having a common storage index

    Capability String
    cap
        a cryptographic object that Tahoe uses to associate with permissions and data.

    Foolscap
        `Foolscap <https://github.com/warner/foolscap/>`_
        an RPC/RMI (Remote Procedure Call / Remote Method Invocation) protocol for use with Twisted


    fURL
    :ref:`fURLs <fURLs>`
        a self-authenticating URL-like string which can be used to locate a remote object using the Foolscap protocol
        (the storage service is an example of such an object)

    introducer
        a Tahoe-LAFS process at a known location configured to re-publish announcements about the location of storage servers

    lease
        state associated with a share informing a storage server of the duration of storage desired by a client

    lease renew secret
        a short secret string which storage servers required to be presented before allowing a particular lease to be renewed

    nURL
    :ref:`NURLs <NURLs>`
        a self-authenticating URL-like string almost exactly like a fURL but without being tied to Foolscap

    pet name
        the *local-only* internal reference, typically for the convenience of the human. (https://codechalleng.es/....)

    share
        a single unit of client-provided arbitrary data to be stored by a storage server
        (in practice, one of the outputs of applying ZFEC encoding to some ciphertext with some additional metadata attached)

    slot
        a group of one or more mutable shares held by a storage server and having a common storage index
        (sometimes "slot" is considered a synonym for "storage index of a slot")

    storage index
        a 16 byte string which can address a slot or a bucket
        (in practice, derived by hashing the encryption key associated with contents of that slot or bucket)

    storage server
        a Tahoe-LAFS process configured to offer storage and reachable over the network for store and retrieve operations

    storage service
        a Python object held in memory in the storage server which provides the implementation of the storage protocol

    swissnum
        a short random string which is part of a fURL/nURL and which acts as a shared secret to authorize clients to use a storage service

    write enabler
        a short secret string which storage servers require to be presented before allowing mutation of any mutable share
